"The Dawn Probe: Investigating the Dawn of the Solar System",4/26/13,22:00,4/26/13,22:50,FALSE,"Robert J. Trembley, volunteer NASA/JPL Solar System Ambassador and local amateur astronomer will talk about the Dawn mission to the asteroid belt to visit asteroid Vesta, and Dwarf Planet Ceres. Ambassadors participate in teleconferences with NASA/JPL engineers, scientists, and mission specialists about current and future NASA projects, then present that information to the public. Lectures often incorporate official NASA materials and insider knowledge. Bob will also have his telescopes available for observing sessions both Friday and Saturday nights, and Solar observing Saturday afternoon - weather permitting.  Speakers include:Robert J. Trembley","Featherstone,PUBLIC
"How to Lie with Statistics: Humor and Heresy in Mathematics",4/27/13,16:00,4/27/13,16:50,FALSE,"Did you know that a full 50% of Americans are below average? Shockingly, this has also been found true for Canadians. This is a presentation of material from the book 'How to Lie with Statistics' written by Darrell Huff, as well as from other sources, as a practical (and funny!) look at how deceptive and silly statistical information can be if not presented soundly and the presentation considered soundly by the end viewer. Vulcan slyness, if you will.  Speakers include:Bill Kolasa","Featherstone,PUBLIC

Speakers include:Steuard Jensen, Marla Fisher, Robert J. Trembley, Richard Herrell, Ida Briggs","Featherstone,PUBLIC
"Urban Astronomy: Your Sky Tonight",4/27/13,22:00,4/27/13,22:50,FALSE,"Robert J. Trembley, volunteer NASA/JPL Solar System Ambassador and local amateur astronomer will talk about things you can see in the urban night sky: ISS fly-overs, Iridium Flares, Meteors, Comets (2 this year!), Aurora... and a couple stars. Bob will also talk about local astronomy clubs, and astronomy-related events that take place in Michigan. Plus: hold a real meteorite! Bob will also have his telescopes available for observing sessions both Friday and Saturday nights, and Solar observing Saturday afternoon - weather permitting.  Speakers include:Robert J. Trembley","Featherstone,PUBLIC
"Science Fact in Science Fiction",4/26/13,21:00,4/26/13,21:50,FALSE,"Enough bitching about 'The Core.' Let's take a look at some examples of science that science fiction movies got right.

"Asteroid Mining: Turning Science Fiction into Science Fact",4/26/13,19:00,4/26/13,19:50,FALSE,"Planetary Resources’ mission is to apply commercial, innovative techniques to explore space. The company is developing low-cost robotic spacecraft to prospect thousands of near-Earth asteroids, with high concentrations of water and precious metals, and will deliver these resources to the point of need, either in space or on Earth. Asteroid mining may sound like fiction, but it’s just science.  Speakers include:Ray Ramadorai","Wisner,PUBLIC
"The Physics of Video Games",4/27/13,13:00,4/27/13,13:50,FALSE,"What makes physics an important part of so many video games? Many great games rely on accurate physics for realism (and fail hilariously when it goes wrong). Others invent their own physics, for better or worse. Our love of games can even inspire genuine scientific exploration of our virtual worlds.  Speakers include:Steuard Jensen","Wisner,PUBLIC
"Is the Fabric of the Universe Double Stiched?",4/27/13,15:00,4/27/13,15:50,FALSE,"Modern physics like relativity, quantum mechanics, and string theory teaches us that our intuition about 'motion' and 'position' is astoundingly wrong. In fact, some information we might hope to measure simply doesn't exist. And if string theory turns out to be accurate, the universe may contain hidden extra dimensions and even an entirely new type of 'space' that would exist alongside the familiar one we know.
