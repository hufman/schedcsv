Getting tired of every Tom, Dick, and Harry with a smart phone or tablet calling themselves “gamers?” Or are the controller jockeys still living in the past? Whether you're a classic gamer, a tablet fiend, or still think this whole video game is a passing craze, come check out Fuzzy and Wally's panel! We compare and contrast the platforms, weight their advantages vs. disadvantages, what each platform has done for the industry, where the future seems to be going with them, and maybe even a QandA at the end! It'll be fun, informative, plus it'll give you a chance to tell idiots we don't know what we're talking about!
