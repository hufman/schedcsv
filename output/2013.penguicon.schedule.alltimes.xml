First with whether you're Atheist or Theist, then also whether you are Gnostic/Agnostic about it. This is NOT a panel discussing or endorsing any religious point of view. It's only defining and identifying religious terms and how they get misused. All religions are welcome and will not be judged. Categorized, but not judged.

Now that the hard part is out of the way in 2012, we're working on plans to add on for 2013. The overall theme for the 4-day event is "superstition" and the possibilities are many. Come and hear about what a theme camp is and how we conceived, designed, built, and partied on a floating platform in the middle of a lake.
